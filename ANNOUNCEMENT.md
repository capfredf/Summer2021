# Syntax Parse Bee 2021

Hi folks,

Write a macro with Racket this summer! Win stickers!

Ground Rules:
* you can write any macro as long as it uses syntax-parse somehow
* enter as many times as you like
* the first 20 individuals who enter will win stickers
* open July 1 to September 1

Submit by opening an issue here: [submit your entry](https://github.com/syntax-objects/Summer2021/issues/new?assignees=&labels=entry&template=enter-the-syntax-parse-bee.md&title=%5Bentry+-+name%2Fdescription+of+macro%5D)

To help you get started, we suggest two categories of before-and-after macro:

1. Code Cleaning : Introduce a macro where there was none before. Look for ways
   to make your source code more beautiful and/or less repetitive.

2. Macro Engineering : Use the tools in syntax-parse to improve an existing
   macro (which may or may not currently use syntax-parse). Try to make the old
   macro more maintainable, more robust against errors, and/or more flexible.

Whatever you decide, we hope that you learn and have fun!
